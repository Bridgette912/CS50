0.  An obscure term referring to a lung disease cause by silica dust.  Also, it is the longest word in the dictionary.
1.  Returns resource usage measures.
2.  16
3.  They are referenced so that copies don't have to be made every time calculate uses them, saving memory usage.
4.  It first checks to make sure there are 2 or 3 arguments, and then loads 
the dictionary and text to be checked.  It then initializes an index for characters 
to be placed.  It moves through each word adding characters to the index until
it reaches a non-alphabetical character.  It then checks if the word is misspelled by
comparing to the dictionary, increases the word count, and resets the index to 0.
This is repeated until it reaches the end of the file.  At the end of the file, it
closes file that were used, and calculates resource usage.
5.  I think it is used because fscanf can lead to buffer overflows if it doesn't know the size of the string in advance.
6.  Since those values won't change, it makes for more efficient code.
7.  I used a hash table that uses an arithmetic shift that takes the hash value and shifts the bits by 2.
8.  It was fast.  Using a hash table was tricky, but helped it run very quickly.
9.  I did not make any changes as it was already fast, and I didn't feel it needed improvement.
10. No, I do not believe so.
